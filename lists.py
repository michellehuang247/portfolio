list = ["cookies",5,"mangoes","gummy bears","pig",2, "hippo"]

##looks into the list, pulls the actual values, not the index
##for item in list:
#    print(item)

##(len(list)) finds the length of this list (which is 7 in this case)
##because of what we put in as the range, it will only print out numbers
for item in range(len(list)):
    #this prints the index numbers
    #print(item)
    #this prints each value
    print (list[item])

##this prints a certain item
#print (list[3])
